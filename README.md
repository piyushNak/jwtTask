Step 4: Install a text editor of your choice. We are using  [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/) Code in this tutorial, but you can use other editors, such as Atom or Sublime Text, if you are more comfortable with those.

Step:5 [Download Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) We are using the Postman application to check the output of the application. We send and receive API calls and check if the JWT is working correctly.
To download the Postman application, go to its [official website.](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
